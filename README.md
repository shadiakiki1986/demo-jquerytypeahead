Demo of [jquery-typeahead](www.runningcoder.org/jquerytypeahead) `game v2`

To run, clone locally and open in browser `file:///path/to/this/repo/game_v2.html`

and type `zombie`

Tested with jquery-typeahead 2.10.6

Take-home messages:

- jquery-typeahead doesn't work with jquery.slim.min.js
- set `cache: false` in `game_v2.js` to avoid confusion between load from cache and error/successful code
